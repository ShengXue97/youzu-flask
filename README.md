## Section A: Introduction To Flask Repository

## 1 Explanation
This Flask repository holds many folders that contain highly important data, and are the backbone of many of the functions 
observed in the React UI. Arguably, the most important directory/modules are:

### 1.1 ./Workspaces
This directory contains the data of all previously processed PDFs for that particular server (contents differ for 
production and development builds). In short, it is responsible for the user being able to save his workspace or return 
to its most recent edit to download the .csv version of the output and even upload questions to the DataBase.

Without this folder and its essential sub-folders (./attribute, ./csv and ./pdf), there would be no saved output and 
users would have to do all the work in that one session.

### 1.2 `app.py` (Section B)
This module is responsible for connecting all back-end logic to the front-end UI, and vice-versa. It is the middle-man 
be it in re-directing the user to another page, or in receiving the POST request upon the user's PDF upload, before 
sending it to `MainV10.py` for effective processing and sending it back to the front-end web-page.

Some important helper modules that are used are:
* `GibberishDetector.py` *(Detects whether contour boxes found are gibberish or actual text, and is part of diagram-text 
segmentation/analysis)*
* `WorkspaceGenerator.py` *(Helper function that holds the logic for generating a saved workspace in the ./Workspaces 
directory)*

### 1.3 `MainV10.py` (Section C)
This module is the backbone of the entire project. As the core of the Digitization project, it takes in the user's uploaded/selected PDF(s) and processes it entirely, distinguishing images from text and segmenting questions from one another. 

The pipeline makes use of the Tesseract Open Source OCR to extract text from images. Its output 
comes in the form of a triple-nested list that `app.py` retrieves, stores and sends it to the front-end UI for the user to mutate this data to his/her liking. Any core adjustments to the back-end code regarding paper output are done here.

### 1.4 `/extraFiles`
This folder contains several scripts that are either used for testing or to generate files in the background on the virtual machine

* #### `jsonsql.py`
This python script contains MySQL queries to alter and change the database using the PyMySQL library. Developer can change
the queries to be executed and run this script to mutate and change the sql database. 

* #### `WorkspaceGenerator.py` 
This is a script that calls MainV10.py to convert pdfs in the 'Avaliable pdfs' into csv files and subsequently saved under Workspaces.
The script is continually running in the background on the virtual machine in a tmux session. 

* #### `update-pdfbank.py`
This is a script that establishes a connection with the MySQL database and updates the 'inLibrary' status of respective files present in
the Workspace folder. The SHA-2 hash for each file is obtained from /Workspace/hash directory and inserted as a row entry in the 'pdfbank'
table. A '1' value will also be inserted in the 'inLibrary' column to indicate positive status. 

### 1.5 `MainV10.html`
Documentation of functions under MainV10.py. For more detailed explanation, please view the MainV10.py script itself.


## Section B: Breakdown of `app.py`

The back-end is built with [flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/ "flask Home Page"), a lightweight Web Server Gateway Interface web application framework optimized for the Python Language. The React is split into multiple tabs, such as the Home Tab, Edit Tab etc. The functions in Flask responsible for React is split according to these tabs below.

## 2 Home Tab functions
### 2.1 Uploadfile
User clicked Choose PDF File or dropped files into the dotted box area. The user’s files will be saved under /ReactPDF folder. If a custom page is defined, PyPDF2 is used to truncate the pdf file. After this, the file is saved under the same folder. The MainV10 script is started using a new thread, while returning success to React. React will then call Stream(method below in Section 2.6).

### 2.2 Pushfile
User clicked Process PDF in one or more files in the pdf table. The appropriate directory where the pdfs are stored will be indicated, which is under /datassd in Azure, and under /pdfs in the developer’s local drive. What happens after is similar to Uploadfile. Custom page range selection is taken into account, and MainV10 script will be called. React will then call Stream(method below in Section 2.6).

### 2.3 Getpdfpages
User either uploaded or pushed a file, and selected to use custom pdf page range. This method is used to feedback to React the number of pages this pdf has, allowing the user to select a range from this pdf page range given.

### 2.4 Killsession
Every Session call of the MainV10 script listens to the event whereby the Session is killed. The Killsession method is called when the user uploads or pushes a new file, thereby killing the previous session to save resources. The Session call identifies that it is killed based on its sessionID.

### 2.5 Get_message
Every Session call of the MainV10 script is given an unique sessionID based on the IP address, timestamp and a random string. The MainV10 script will save the progress of this session in a .json file with the sessionID. This shows the current question, page and stage. Get_message simply reads this .json file with the progress information and returns to Stream.

### 2.6 Stream
As mentioned above, Stream is called by React after the user uploads or pushes a file. Stream calls Get_message to monitor the progress of the digitisation process of MainV10 script. This progress information is returned to React, which updates its progress bar. When React detects that the progress is full, it will call Getresult.

### 2.7 Getresult
Reads the output CSV of the Session call of the MainV10 script. The correct output CSV file is identified based on the unique sessionID string. A triple nested list containing the pdf information is generated and returned to React. The first layer is each page, the second layer is each question in the page, and the third layer is the attributes of each question.

### 2.8 Listpdf
This populates the pdf table with information. The appropriate directory where the pdfs are stored will be indicated, which is under /datassd in Azure, and under /pdfs in the developer’s local drive. Note that since there are ~10,000 pdf files in the system, it will be slow to retrieve all of them in one batch. Hence, total_batches is specified as 10, where React will send 10 requests to Flask with each request returning ~1000 pdf files only. The pdf information will populate the pdf table as it arrives, reducing the latency time for the user.

Each pdf entry in the table has a Status attribute. This can be of four types: Not Processed, In Library Only, In Database Only or In Library and Database. Each pdf file is hashed using SHA512 from its Base64 string. This is stored as an entry in the pdfbank MySQL table, with attributes inDatabase and inLibrary. Listpdf will perform a Select query, and update the Status attribute of the pdf entry based on its inDatabase and inLibrary attributes.

### 2.9 Openpdf
The user clicks Download PDF on one or more pdf files in the pdf table. The appropriate directory where the pdfs are stored will be indicated, which is under /datassd in Azure, and under /pdfs in the developer’s local drive. The pdf file will be read and encoded in Base64 format, which is returned back to the user. React converts this Base64 string into a downloadable pdf file for the user.

## 3. Edit Tab functions
### 3.1 Findworkspace
First function called when the user clicks Save Workspace. If a workspace with the same name under Workspaces/csv/ already exists, the user will be prompted if the user wants to overwrite the existing workspace. Each Workspace is stored in three separate files, under Workspaces/csv/, Workspaces/pdf/, and Workspaces/attributes/. The csv file stores the questions data of the pdf file. The pdf file stores the Base64 string of the pdf file. The attribute file stores the exam paper data such as school name and type of exam.

### 3.2 renameworkspace
Second function called when the user clicks Save Workspace. The Workspace files under Workspaces/csv/, Workspaces/pdf/, and Workspaces/attributes/ will each be renamed accordingly.

### 3.3 Savecsv
Third function called when the user clicks Save Workspace. The csv file is stored under Workspaces/csv/. The csv file stores the questions data of the pdf file.
### 3.4 Savepdf
Fourth function called when the user clicks Save Workspace. The pdf file is stored under Workspaces/pdf/. The pdf file stores the Base64 string of the pdf file. Updates the inWorkspace attribute of the pdf file in pdfbank to 1.




### 3.5 Saveattribute
Fifth function called when the user clicks Save Workspace. The attribute file is stored under Workspaces/attributes/. The attribute file stores the exam paper data such as school name and type of exam.

### 3.6 Checkdatabase
First function called when the user clicks Upload all questions to database or Upload selected questions to database. The SHA512 hash of the pdf file that the user is trying to upload will be received from React. Flask will check the number of entries that exist in qbank with the specified SHA512 hash. This number is returned to React.

### 3.7 Updatedatabase
Second function called when the user clicks Upload all questions to database or Upload selected questions to database. Qbank stores all the questions that the user uploads. Each entry contains the question json information and the corresponding pdf SHA512 hash. All previous entries in qbank with the same pdf SHA512 hash will be deleted, as the user is already prompted under Checkdatabase. Updatedatabase creates the question json and pdf hash value based on the data received from React, and inserts these values into the qbank database. Furthermore, the entry with the corresponding pdf SHA512 hash in pdfbank will have its inDatabase attribute updated as 1.

## 4 Workspace Tab functions
### 4.1 Openworkspace
The user clicks open workspace button of a workspace entry in the workspace table. How a workspace is saved is explained under Findworkspace. Each of the three files corresponding to a single workspace is loaded into Flask, from Workspaces/csv/, Workspaces/pdf/ and Workspaces/attributes/. These data are passed back to React. React then opens the Edit tab based on these data. The csv data is used to produce the questions on the right, the pdf data is used to produce the pdf preview on the left, while the attribute data is used to produce the file information on the top.

### 4.2 Deleteworkspace
The user clicks delete workspace button of a workspace entry in the workspace table. All three files corresponding to the single workspace are deleted from Flask.The entry in pdfbank corresponding to the pdf SHA512 hash of this pdf file will have its inWorkspace attribute updated to 0. Note that this happens only if this Workspace is the only Workspace left with the pdf hash value.
### 4.3 Listworkspace
The user clicks on Refresh data in the workspace table, or is simply called when the user clicks the Library Tab. The Status attribute of the workspace is the same as explained under Listpdf. The attributes of the Workspaces(Name, Last Modified and Status) are received from the pdfbank table with a SELECT query. This Workspaces data is returned to React to populate the Workspaces table.

## 5 Database Tab functions
### 5.1 Getdatabase
The user clicks on Refresh data in the database table, or is simply called when the user clicks the Database Tab. The various attributes of each question are received from the qbank table with a SELECT query. This database data is returned to React to populate the database table.

## Section C: Breakdown of `MainV10.py`
Flask calls the MainV10 script, which is the script responsible for the digitisation of exam papers.

## 6. Digitisation Pipeline
![alt text](https://github.com/ShengXue97/youzu-flask/blob/master/Additonalmages/Pipeline%20and%20Prototype.jpg 'Illustration of Pipeline')

### 6.1 PDF to Image
Uploaded pdf will be converted to images, and the attributes of the exam paper will be extracted. Negative-scale images will be converted to white if they fall below a certain threshold.

### 6.2 Question Detection
Using Tesseract-OCR and our algorithm, small images of question numbers and their y-coordinates on each page of the paper will be extracted. 

### 6.3 Image Cropping
Based on the y-coordinates of the question numbers extracted from the previours step, each page of the paper will be cropped to fit only the contents of a single question. They will be subsequently saved under the /TempImages folder.

### 6.4 Image Pre-processing
Several image-preprocessing techniques available in the OpenCV computer vision library will be utilised to improve the quality before being passed to the OCR. Below techniques are also used to remove unwanted long lines along margins present in some pages of papers.

    *Examples of techniques used (not exhaustive):*
    * Gaussian Blurring
    * Grayscaling
    * Morphological operations like erosion, dilation, opening, closing etc
    
### 6.5 Contour Detection
After image is cleaned and denoised, cv2.findContours() function is used to obtains countours wrapping blocks of text on the image. Contours extremely close in proximity will then be merged, while very small contours will be erased. These contours will be passed into our defined draw_contours() function, which will use the cv2.boundingRect() function to outline (rectangular in shape) blocks of text/diagrams. Blank lines in the question will be detected, and a '_______' text will be inserted in the corresponding position in the processed text thereafter. Based on the x,y,w,h coordinates of the blocks obtained from cv2.boundingRect() function, the region will be cropped out and subsequently passed into the OCR to be converted to text strings. 
Illustration of bounding box:![alt text](https://github.com/ShengXue97/youzu-flask/blob/master/Additonalmages/contour.jpg)

### 6.6 Diagram/Text Classification
Using Gibberish Detector module, Hough Lines and aspect ratio of the contours, the cropped region will be deemed to be readable text or diagram. For text that passes the filters, it will be appended to a list. Otherwise, digrams will be saved under the /TempImages folder and the base64 string will be appended to the same list.

### 6.7 Diagram/Text Segmentation
Diagrams under /TempImages folder:![alt text](https://github.com/ShengXue97/youzu-flask/blob/master/Additonalmages/tempimages.PNG)
Base64 strings of diagrams sorted under the /TempImages folder will be accessed and appended to the corresponding questions while text will be segmented into the question title and options using regular expressions. 

### 6.8 Create Pandas Dataframe
All essential and processed content will be inserted into a pandas dataframe, with each question taking up one row. The output will be saved as a csv file, which can be found under Output/ directory.


## Section D: Introduction To React Repository
A simple React website which allows you to upload Singapore primary/secondary school exam papers in PDF, and receive
the output of a CSV file containing the text of the questions.

The front-end code of this project is split into three (build, public and src) folders. SRC is the most relevant folder.

## 7 React Website /src directory
The src folder hosts all the logic for the front-end UI, with `App.js` routing all the essential components in the 
components folder to the back-end flask framework. The main components are as follows:

### 7.1 Home.js
This is the component responsible for the first page the user sees on loading the UI. It allows the user to upload PDFs for processing on the back-end, or process multiple PDFs at once using the file selector, since the page features over 10,000 available PDFs from different schools and subjects.

Helper components in this Component are `Drawer.js` and `ServerInfo.js`. `Drawer.js` is the sidebar that allows the userto navigate to different pages, while `ServerInfo.js` controls which server the front-end is running on (since we use both development and production builds).

The essential functions in Home.js are, but not limited to:
* User drops or uploads file/s -> functions are called in this order
    1. `onDrop()` - Calls `processFile()` for each file, opening a new tab for multiple files
    2. `processFile()` - Posts an axios request to kill previous session in the same tab. Calls `pollServer()`
    3. `pollServer()` - Two cases:
        - Custom page range is selected: An axios request is made to get the pdf pages.A pop-up is shown asking user to choose the page range, and `sendFileToServer()` will be called when user clicks confirm.
        - No custom page range is selected: `sendFileToServer` is called
    4. `sendFileToServer()` - (Posts file including specified pages to process, to the back-end using `/uploadfile`, since this file belongs to the user and not the server. Calls `startStream()`.
    5. `startStream()` - Initiates a stream to Flask at `/stream`, which will periodically request for the progress of the session from the server. Each response from the server will call `source.onmessage` function, which updates the progress bar and information accordingly. This function also monitors when the file is finished processing, during which it will make an axios request to `/getresult`. The edit tab will be opened with the results of the digitisation.

* User selects file/s in pdf table and clicks "Process PDF" -> functions are called in this order
    1. `openMultiplePdf()` - Calls `openSinglePdf()` for each file, opening a new tab for multiple files
    2. `openSinglePdf()` - Posts an axios request to kill previous session in the same tab. Two cases:
        - Custom page range is selected: An axios request is made to get the pdf pages.A pop-up is shown asking user to choose the page range, and `sendFileToServer()` will be called when user clicks confirm.
        - No custom page range is selected: `sendFileToServer` is called
    4. `sendFileToServer()` - (Posts file including specified pages to process, to the back-end using `/pushfile`, since this file belongs to the server and not the user. Calls `startStream()`.
    5. `startStream()` - Initiates a stream to Flask at `/stream`, which will periodically request for the progress of the session from the server. Each response from the server will call `source.onmessage` function, which updates the progress bar and information accordingly. This function also monitors when the file is finished processing, during which it will make an axios request to `/getresult`. The edit tab will be opened with the results of the digitisation.

* User clicks on checkbox "Choose custom PDF page range"
    - `handleChangeCheckbox()` - Sets the state of `useCustomPageRange` accordingly, which is used in `pollServer()` and `openSinglePdf()` to decide which of the two cases will occur.

* User selects multiple pdf files in the pdf table and clicks "Download PDF"
    - `downloadPDFs()` - For each of the pdf file that the user has selected, a download link will be created.

* Other functions
    - `getCurrentProgress()` - returns the current progress of the digitisation
    - `setCurrentProgress` - sets the current progress of the digitisation, which is used by the progress bar
    - `setExtraMsg()` - sets the message in the progress information box above the progress bar

While there are many other essential features, these are crucial for the site to work and communicate with the back-end 
server. The other features can be found in the component and have self-explanatory purposes on loading the UI.

### 7.2 Edit.js
This is main feature of the project, where the user is brought to this page upon the successful processing of a PDF to an editable .csv file. By sending a GET request to the back-end server, the processed data is displayed beautifully on the Edit page for the user to edit the questions and diagrams, before saving them as a Workspace or selected/all questions to the Database.

The helper component in this Component is `Question.js`, which is solely responsible for allowing mutable question 
titles and options, along with other functions that work on *individual* questions.
 
The essential functions in `Edit.js` are, but not limited to:
* User clicks "Save Workspace"
    - `handleOnSaveWorkspace()` - Saves the current edited workspace into the Library, where the user can re-access later
* User clicks "Download as .csv"
    - `handleCleanCsvRows()` - Saves the current version of the workspace as a .csv file, with all relevant paper details
* User clicks "Revert to Original"
    - `handleOnRevertToOriginal()` - Reverts all changes to the last time the user saved **and** closed the workspace
* User clicks "Upload all Questions to Database"
    - `handleOnUpdateDatabase()` - Sends all questions with valid answers to the DataBase, **overriding** questions of the same paper already in the DataBase.
* User clicks "Upload Selected Questions to Database"
    - `handleOnUploadQnsToDatabase()` - Similar, but overrides DataBase with only questions that have their checkboxes 
ticked)*
* User clicks "Delete Selected Questions"
    - `handleOnDeleteQuestions()` - Deletes all questions that have their checkboxes ticked
* User edits the content of a single question
    - `handleOnChangeQuestion()` - Updates the internal representations of the questions data

These functions are responsible for the logic specific to each question. They are passed onto the helper component, `Question.js`:
* User clicks on "Add a new question below" for a single question
    - `handleOnAddQuestion()` - Appends a new question below the question that had the "Add Question" button clicked
* User clicks "Delete this question" for a single question
    - `handleonDeleteSingleQuestion()` - Deletes that particular question who had its "Delete Question" button clicked
* User clicks "Add cropped area on preview to this question" or "Upload your own diagram!" for a single question
    - `handleOnAddimage()` - Adds a diagram to the diagram portion for that question, based on the page preview crop or user image file upload
* User clicks the cross button for one of the image of a single question
    - `handleOnDeleteImage()` - Deletes that particular diagram from that question

While there are other essential functions, these are some of them that make up the required logic for the Edit page. The
other unmentioned features are also self-explanatory in `Edit.js`/`Question.js`, such as checkbox selection logic.

### 7.3 Library.js
This component is responsible for making the saved content from the back-end (/Workspaces under youzu-flask repository) 
accessible and displayed on the front-end UI.

While there are no helper components, `Library.js` is heavily reliant on communication with the back-end server via [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios "Axios Page"), a `Promise` based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.

The essential functions in `Library.js` are, but not limited to:
* User clicks on "Refresh Data", or simply opened the Library Tab
    - `listWorkspace()` - Posts the user ip address and port to the server, and displays the server response data containing all the names of the saved workspaces under the /Workspace folder in the flask repository
* User clicks on "Open Workspace" for one of the workspaces in the workspace table
    - `openWorkspace()` - Similar communication with the back-end server to open a new window for the Edit page, using data from the server response corresponding to the selected Workspace
* User clicks on "Edit" for one of the workspaces in the workspace table
    - `renameWorkspace()` - Similar communication with the back-end server, but to edit the name of that Workspace using its name
* User clicks on "Delete" for one of the workspaces in the workspace table
    - `deleteWorkspace()` - Similar communication with the back-end server, but to remove that Workspace using its name


While there are other essential functions, the three listed are the most important in the logic of the Library.

### 7.4 Database.js
This component is responsible for allowing the user to view all questions and paper details saved on the DataBase 
using [PyMySQL](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/ "PyMySQL Homepage"), a Pure Python MySQL Driver.

There are also no helper components, except heavy reliance on the back-end communication to `App.py` on the youzu-flask 
repository.

The most essential function in Database.js is `getDatabase()`, which receives the data from the back-end server by 
making a request with `axios.post`, before displaying the response data for the user's easy viewing.

Using [material-table](https://material-table.com/#/ "material-table's homepage"), a React Data Table component based on
[material-ui](https://material-ui.com/ "material-ui's homepage"), many features are available on the Database and 
Library pages (such as a search feature and download button for users that want a .csv version of the DataBase/Library.)

* User clicks on "Refresh Data", or simply opened the Database Tab
    - `getDatabase()` *(Post a request for the database "qbank" table, and displays the server response data in the database table*

## 8 FAQ
Below are the Frequently Asked Questions.
1. 
Q: `pymysql.connect(host='localhost', user='root', passwd='', db='')` is found in almost every function of `appy.py`, do I need to change all of them according to my own database setup?
A: Yes. The password and db fields should be changed according to your own setup.

2. 
Q:  `WorkspaceGenerator.py` is not found in the main directory, is it under 'extraFiles'?
A: Yes. It is.

3. 
Q: `WorkspaceGenerator.py` script is continually running in the background on the virtual machine in a tmux session. How about Windows OS?
A: Most virtual machines run in Linux, which supports the tmux session. It is not recommended to run this script on your Windows computer, unless you wish to keep it on for days on end. To run on your Windows computer, simply run the script without tmux session.

And the other line of serverInfo commented. The other line is for testing on your local computer.
5. `npm install`
6. `npm start`


## 2 Tmux sessions
The digitisation pipeline enlists the usage of multiple tmux sessions running in the background to either keep the flask/react servers running or to continually run certain scripts. 

Info on tmux commands: https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/ 

List of tmux sessions that should be running:
Steps to set up tmux sessions (from terminal):
1. Enter `tmux new -s <session name>`
2. Execute scripts
3. Rename session using `ctrl+b` then `$`
4. `Ctrl+b`, then `d` to leave the session
5. To see list of session, enter `tmux list-sessions`
6. To attach to session, enter `tmux attach-session <session name>`

The flask and react sessions are responsible to keep the flask and react servers running on both the production and development sites, while the ‘workspace-generator’ and ‘update-pdfbank’ sessions will convert pdfs to csv files, and update statuses of files in the Library respectively.  

## 3 Installing and set-up of MySQL database

### 3.1 Installation of MySQL
For linux installation, please refer to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/linux-installation.html

Download page for MySQL APT repository: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/apt/

For windows installation, please refer to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html.

* Note: Version used is MySQL Server 8.0

### 3.2 Install Pymysql library
Pymysql is a pure-Python MySQL client library. 
Install it by running the command `pip install PyMySQL` on the terminal
Running the following commands may help to resolve some errors during installation/running of script
* `pip3 install --upgrade setuptools`
* `sudo apt-get install python3-dev libmysqlclient-dev`

### 3.3 Installling a visual database administration tool
The suggested client to be used is DBeaver, and you may download it from https://dbeaver.io/download/. Otherwise, MySQL workbench which can downloaded during the installation of MySQL client can be used.

### 3.4 Setting up MySQL
After installing the MySQL client, configure your login credentials and user priviliges. Set up password for root user and remember it

* Run the command in terminal to launch mysql shell:
`sudo mysql -u root -p `
* To update password for root user:
`UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string = PASSWORD('password') WHERE User = 'root';`
* Create database ('youzu' is the default db name we are using) in mysql shell:
`mysql> create database youzu;`
* Create table in database ('qbank' table will be automatically be created by uploading questions to database on digitisation website):
`mysql>CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
